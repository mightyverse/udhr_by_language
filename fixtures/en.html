      <p> On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United  
Nations adopted and proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human  
Rights the full text of which appears in the following pages. Following 
 this historic act the Assembly called upon all Member countries to  
publicize the text of the Declaration and "to cause it to be

    <h3><a name="ap" id="ap"></a>PREAMBLE</h3>
    <p> Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and
  inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the 
foundation  of freedom, justice and peace in the world, </p>
    <p> Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in
  barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the 
 advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech  
and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the  
highest aspiration of the common people, </p>
    <p> Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have  
recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and  
oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law, </p>
    <p> Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations, </p>
    <p> Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter  
reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and  
worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and  
have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life 
 in larger freedom, </p>
    <p> Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in  
co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal  
respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, </p>
    <p> Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is 
of  the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,</p>
    <p> <strong>Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS</strong>
 as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to
  the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this
  Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education
  to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive  
measures, national and international, to secure their universal and  
effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member  
States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their  
jurisdiction.</p>
