<h4><b>Preamble</b></h4>
<p>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and 
inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation 
of freedom, justice and peace in the world, </p>
<p>Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in 
barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the 
advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech 
and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the 
highest aspiration of the common people, </p>
<p>Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have 
recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression,
 that human rights should be protected by the rule of law, </p>
<p>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations, </p>
<p>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter 
reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and 
worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and 
have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life 
in larger freedom, </p>
<p>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in 
cooperation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect 
for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms, </p>
<p>Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the
 greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge, </p>
<p>Now, therefore, </p>
<p>The General Assembly, </p>
<p>Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common 
standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that
 every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration 
constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote 
respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, 
national and international, to secure their universal and effective 
recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States 
themselves and among the peoples of territories under their 
jurisdiction. </p>

 belongs to the Indo-European family, Germanic group, West Germanic 
subgroup and is the official language of over 1.7 billion people. Home 
speakers are over 330 million. As regards the evolution of the English 
language, three main phases can be distinguished. From the 6th and 5th 
centuries B.C., the Celtics are believed to have lived in the place 
where we now call Britain. Britain first appeared in the historical 
records as Julius Caesar campaigned there in 55-54 B.C. Britain was 
conquered in 43 A.D. and remained under the Roman occupation until 410 
A.D. Then came from the European Continent the Germanic tribes, who 
spoke the languages belonging to the West Germanic branch of the 
Indo-European language family. First the Jutes from Jutland (present-day
 Denmark) in the 3rd century A.D., then in the 5th century, the Saxons 
from Friesland, Frisian Islands and north-west Germany, finally the 
Angles, from present-day Schleswig-Holstein (a German Land) who settled 
 north of the Thames. The words "England" and "English", come from the 
word, "Angles". During the Old English period of 450-1,100 A.D. (first 
phase), Britain experienced the spread of Christianity, and, from the 
8th century, the invasion and occupation by the Vikings, called the 
"Danes." The most important event of the second phase, the Middle 
English period (1100-1500 A.D.) was the Norman Conquest of 1066. The 
Normans were the North Men, meaning the Vikings from Scandinavia, 
settled in the Normandy region of France from the 9th century, who had 
assimilated themselves to the French language and culture. English was 
much influenced by French during this time. During the third phase, the 
Modern English period (1500 onwards), English spread to the world as the
 British Empire colonised many lands. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) 
lived in this period, and in 1755 Samuel Johnson completed "A Dictionary
 of the English Language" with about 40,000 entries, which contributed 
to the standardisation of the English language. The English language 
which spread to the world created many of its variants, the most 
prominent of which is American English. The American English writing 
system is said to owe much to Noah Webster's "An American Dictionary of 
the English Language" which was completed in 1828. Other important 
varieties include Indian English, Australian English, and many 
English-based Creoles and Pidgins.</span>
